\title{Find Duplicate WAV Files by Content Hash}
\usage{
find_duplicate_wavs(dir, parallel = TRUE, n_cores = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{dir}{Character. Path to the directory to search. Must exist.}

\item{parallel}{Logical. If TRUE, use parallel processing for hashing. Default is TRUE.}

\item{n_cores}{Integer. Number of cores to use. Default is NULL (auto-detect).}
}
\value{
A named character vector where:
  \itemize{
    \item Names are MD5 hashes of duplicate file contents
    \item Values are representative file paths (first occurrence) for each duplicate set
  }
  Returns empty character vector if no duplicates found.
  Returns NULL invisibly if no WAV files found.
}
\description{
Searches a directory and its immediate subdirectories for duplicate WAV files
based on MD5 hash of file contents. Returns one representative file path for
each set of duplicates found.
}
\details{
The function searches the specified directory and its immediate subdirectories
(one level deep) for WAV files. File matching is case-insensitive. Duplicates
are identified by computing MD5 hashes of the binary file contents.

Requires the \code{digest} package to be installed.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Find duplicate WAV files
dups <- find_duplicate_wavs("/path/to/audio/library")

# Print duplicate sets
if (length(dups) > 0) {
  print(dups)
}
}
